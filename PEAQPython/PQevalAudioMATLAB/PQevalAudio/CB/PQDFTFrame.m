% Calculate the peak factor. The signal is a sinusoid windowed with
% a Hann window. The sinusoid frequency falls between DFT bins. The
% peak of the frequency response (on a continuous frequency scale) falls
% between DFT bins. The largest DFT bin value is the peak factor times
% the peak of the continuous response.

%  NF  - Frame (DFT) length samples
%  NW  - Window length samples
